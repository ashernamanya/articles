Edit, Delete and Validations - Text directions and code
Section 4, Lecture 62
To find an article with id 2 and edit it's title:

article = Article.find(2) # Here assumption is article with id of 2 was being looked for

article.title = "This is an edited title"

article.save

To delete an article, example with id 5:

article = Article.find(5)

article.destroy

To add validations presence and length validations to article model for title and description:

class Article < ActiveRecord::Base

validates :title, presence: true, length: {minimum: 3, maximum: 50}

validates :description, presence: true, length: {minimum: 10, maximum: 300}

end

If using Rails 5, the first line above would be -> class Article < ApplicationRecord

To find errors in article object while saving (if it's rolled back):

article.errors.any?

article.errors.full_messages
